      <h2>Album Review: Melodrama by Lorde</h2>

      <img class="album-art" src="img/melodrama.jpg" width="100%" alt="melodrama cover art"></img>
      <p>I adore this album. When I first listened to it in June 2017, I remember thinking that I'd been living this album for the past six months without even realizing it. It's been on pretty much constant replay on my Spotify since it came out on June 15, 2017. I love Melodrama. It's in my top three albums of all time. It can be a difficult album for me to listen to sometimes, because I feel that it so closely reflects my thoughts and feelings during a particularly turbulent time in my life. Lorde has stated that the album is meant to loosely follow the events of a house party -- the joy and pain, the ebbs and flows of young adulthood.
      </p>
      <p>That said, I can see how this album could be seen as underwhelming to someone who didn't go through an experience similar to what Lorde discusses over and over in this album. It's definitely thematically very different from Pure Heroine. PH was very detached, and that gave it a certain cool feeling. Any chill that Lorde had when she was sixteen is long gone. She deserves to live her life, not spend it sitting on the sidelines making erudite observations. I think in an interview she said Pure Heroine was like watching people get drunk and Melodrama is about jumping into the fray and getting wasted yourself. So at least Lorde and I are on the same page here.</p>

      <p>My favorite song is "Hard Feelings/Loveless", followed closely by "Sober".</p>
      <div>
        <h4>Track listing:</h4>
        <b>1. Green Light</b>
        <p>Lorde has stated that this song is about the first night after a break-up, when all you want is to not care about that other person anymore, to not feel their shadow following you where ever you go. I could think this song also makes sense if you view it from the perspective of wanting to be with someone that you know you can't be with, because they're not interested or they're already in a relationship. Musically, I think this song is so creative and original. It doesn't sound like anything else on the radio, in my opinion. This song is dark green and dark blue in my mind.</p>
        <b>2. Sober</b>
        <p>I wish "Sober" had been released as a single because I think it would have done well on the radio, and because I think it's one of the coolest pop songs I've ever heard. Lorde did a Song Exploder episode where she dissects the construction of "Sober" and takes us through its development process. Did you know that there's a sample of a tiger roar at the very beginning of the chorus? Listen for it next time. Super  cool. This song is green to me. </p>
        <b>3. Homemade Dynamite</b>
        <p>This song spoke to me the least out of all the songs on the album. It's still good, but it doesn't have the same type of emotional depth that I tend to look for in my favorite songs. Also I'm not really in a "Homemade Dynamite" place in my life anymore -- maybe it would have resonated with me more a year ago. I see this song as kind of orange/yellow, surrounded by inky dark blue.</p>
        <b>4. The Louvre</b>
        <p>"The Louvre" is the feeling of falling in love, to me. But not like, good love. It's falling in love where you know it's not going to work out, and you know this person isn't right for you, but you do it anyways. I don't really know how to describe it other than that. This song has a light pink color to me, which really makes it stand out from the darker hues of the rest of the album. It's sort of like this song is the only one that takes place during the daytime, and all the rest are at night or at dusk. And "Perfect Places" is at sunrise, obviously. Anyways, this song means a lot to me. I love the production and the outro. This is my favorite song to play on the guitar.</p>
        <b>5. Liability</b>
        <p>I really like "Liability". It's pretty much my go-to "I need to cry" song. It has a deep purple color to me. I don't have much to say about it, besides that it means a lot to me. I saw an interview where Lorde talked about listening to "Higher" by Rihanna and crying in an Uber before she wrote this song. I listened to "Higher" for the first time after learning that, so I'd like to publically thank Lorde for introducing me to that beautiful song.  </p>
        <b>6. Hard Feelings/Loveless</b>
        <p>My favorite song on the album! It's so heartbreaking and so relatable and it's amazing that Lorde was able to create such a powerful song out of such a small moment: you're sitting with someone and you know that it's the last time you'll be with them in this way. You know that your next interaction will be avoiding eye contact, walking the other way even though it's less convenient. And you're sad because you're thinking about everything that has led up to this moment and you just have to let yourself be sad for that moment and feel the hard feelings of love.</p>

        <p>The instrumental component of this song is just as important as the lyrics. It sounds like a yawning void, like looking for the first time into the new, slightly lonelier life you will soon face. Then during the bridge part, it sounds like pieces of metal being  <i>torn</i> apart, or a car crash happening in slow motion, which is exactly what this moment feels like. Then, my favorite part:</p>

        <p class="lyrics">
          Three years, loved you every single day, made me weak<br>
          It was real for me, yup, real for me <br>
          Now I'll fake it every single day <br>
          'Til I don't need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave <br>
          But I still remember everything <br>
          How we'd drift buying groceries
          How you'd dance for me<br>
          I'll start letting go of little things<br>
          'Til I'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah. <br>
        </p>

         <p>After all the dramatics are gone, you're alone and all you can think about is what you've lost and how the hell you're going to move on. It's a  very specific feeling and I'm so glad Lorde decided to write a song about it.</p>

         <b>7. Sober II (Melodrama)</b>
         <p>I love when pop artists aren't afraid to use instruments beyond guitars, synthesizers, and drums. This song is like a breath of fresh air. The strings! The piano! They're so beautiful! And the lyrics are great too – here Lorde answers all of the questions she asked in "Sober".</p>

         <b>8. Writer in the Dark</b>
         <p>My favorite part is the second verse:</p>
         <p class="lyrics">
           I still feel you, now and then <br>
           Slow like pseudo-ephedrine <br>
           When you see me, will you say I've changed? <br>
           I ride the subway, read the signs <br>
           I let the seasons change my mind <br>
           I love it here, since I stopped needing you <br>
         </p>
         <p>I truly think "I let the seasons change my mind" is one of the loveliest lyrics I've ever heard in my life. What a beautiful sentiment.</p>

         <b>9. Supercut</b>
         <p>I love that this song is sort of like an echo of "Green Light". You can hear the same wild piano in the background, but it's far more subtle than the first time you heard it. This song is like looking back on your pain a year later and seeing the parts that still hurt and the parts that feel so far away from who you are now. This song doesn't have a firm color to me -- it's sort of a mix of green and black, but it's far less defined than other songs. </p>
         <b>10. Liability (Reprise)</b>
         <p>I picture this song as the emotional precipice of <i>Melodrama</i>. Specifically the moment where Lorde sings "But you're not what you thought you were" over and over. That's the quiet but powerfully beating heart of the entire album. It makes me shiver even after a year of listening to it.</p>
         <b>11. Perfect Places</b>
         <p>I really like this song. The music video is stunning. One tiny little thing that I noticed: in this song, Lorde sings "I'm nineteen and I'm on fire", right? Well, way back in 2010, Jack Antonoff (Lorde's co-writer and co-producer for <i>Melodrama</i>) wrote a song for his band Steel Train called "Children of the 90's (I'm Not the Same)", in which he sings</p>
         <p class="lyrics">
           Heart caught fire with the flames of death <br>
           I'm nineteen years old, let it burn, let it burn <br>
        </p>
        <p>I think it's cute. Unintentional, I'm sure, but cute.</p>
