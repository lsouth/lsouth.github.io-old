Gone Now,Bleachers,Dream of Mickey Mantle,1,4,"""[Intro]
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
I feel like I'm missing more and more and more every time
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
I wanna be grateful
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
I wanna be grateful
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
I don't think I'm intimidated

[Verse 1]
All the hope I had when I was young, I hope I wasn't wrong
I miss those days so I sing a don't take the money song
That's why I'm up in my room tonight whistling wind out my teeth
'Cause somebody didn't fix them nice (no)
Well some things just don't turn out right (no)

[Verse 2]
Kim's video closed and a war goes on and on
All the hope I had when I was young, I hope I wasn't wrong
That's why I'm out in the street tonight whistling wind out my teeth
'Cause somebody didn't fix them nice (no)
You know some things just don't turn out right

[Chorus]
Rolling thunder had cursed my bedroom
Heard from your mother, she don't recognize you
Now Mickey Mantle left on a Sunday
And all of the neighborhood rushes home to pray

[Bridge]
Rolling thunder (yeah) cursed my bedroom (yeah)
We're rushing home to pray (yeah)
Rolling thunder (yeah) cursed my bedroom (yeah)
We're rushing home to pray (yeah)
Rolling thunder (yeah) cursed my bedroom (yeah)
We're rushing home to pray (yeah)
Rolling thunder (yeah) cursed my bedroom (yeah)
We're rushing home to pray (yeah)
Rolling thunder (yeah) cursed my bedroom (yeah)
We're rushing home to pray (yeah)
Rolling thunder (yeah) cursed my bedroom (yeah)
Rolling thunder (yeah) cursed my bedroom (yeah)

[Chorus]
Rolling thunder had cursed my bedroom
Heard from your mother, she don't recognize you
Now Mickey Mantle left on a Sunday
And all of the neighborhood rushes home to pray

[Outro]
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
One foot out and I know the weight is coming
Because I left it by the bed last night
Open my eyes and I stare and pray for light
Always one foot out when you say goodbye to the one that you love"""
Gone Now,Bleachers,Goodmorning,2,4,"""[Verse 1]
Woke up, I知 in the in-between honey
One foot out and I know the weight is coming
Because I left it by the bed last night
Open my eyes and I stare and pray for light
Always one foot out when you say goodbye to the one that you love
One dream away from the ones above
That痴 such a rhythm in my life these days
So I hold on tight and I learn to behave

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Because I lied to you (I lied to you)
I lied to your face in the summer (your face in the summer)
You had long hair then (you had long hair then)
(I知 coming back from the dead)

[Chorus]
I'm singing out back:
Good morning to the cops (oh)
Good morning to my upstairs neighbor
And to the kids at 42
Anyone who lent me a favor
I wish that I could stop (oh)
Now I wish that I could live a little safer
I知 watching all of the nights go blue
Somebody lend me a favor soon

[Verse 2]
Woke up in the corner store, someone saying my name
Everybody moving around, acting like nothing had changed
But something had changed in me (yeah, she touched me)
Yeah, she touched me said I know you池e not to blame
What a weight to live under
What a lie that痴 been covered
I知 talking about (I'm a comedian) rolling thunder
I know I left you on the street last night
So I知 holding on, grabbing at a light

[Pre-Chorus 2]
How come I lied to you? (I lied to you)
I lied to your face in the summer (your face in the summer)
I had my hair short then (I had my hair short then)
(I知 coming back from the dead)

[Chorus]
I'm singing out back:
Good morning to the cops (oh)
Good morning to my upstairs neighbor
And to the kids at 42
Anyone who lent me a favor
I wish that I could stop (oh)
Now I wish that I could live a little safer
I知 watching all of the nights go blue
Somebody lend me a favor soon

[Outro]
I know it's always been him
You just gotta get home soon
I'm coming for you, ooh
It's always been you
I just gotta get home soon, ooh"""
