Some Nights,fun,17,2/21/2012,#ffd396,Some Nights (Intro),1,0,3,7,"<p>My friend who vehemently despises fun likes to refer to this song as ""circus music"", which I think is probably pretty accurate. I love it, though. I think it's a bold way to open an album. Also, I really like that they made a music video for this weird half-song even though it wasn't a single.</p>"
Some Nights,fun,17,2/21/2012,#ffd396,Some Nights,2,0.1,4,10,"<p>I remember listening to this song on the radio in the summer of 2013 as I drove to my summer job mowing lawns in Denver. I had to drive on this really scary portion of the highway and as a new driver it was terrifying. Some Nights would often come on the radio and I remember 16-year-old me identifying heavily with wanting my lips to build a castle and simultaneously wanting them to fall off. As I prepared myself to spend the day doing manual labor in the middle of a Colorado summer, the line ""Who the fuck wants to die alone, all caught up in the desert sun?"" also felt particularly relevant to my life.</p> <p>That line references my favorite song from Nate's old band, The Format, where he sings:</p> <p class=lyrics>And these last three years, I know they've been hard<br>But now it's time to get out of the desert and into the sun, even if it's alone.</p><p>The song is called ""On Your Porch"" and it's worth a listen for anyone who likes fun."
Some Nights,fun,17,2/21/2012,#ffd396,We Are Young,3,0.2,3,9,"<p>Is there anything else left to say about We Are Young? I think it's one of those songs that becomes so well known outside of its album that it becomes difficult to see it as part of the rest of the work. When I think of Some Nights, I don't think of We Are Young. Maybe that's bad, or maybe it just is.</p>"
Some Nights,fun,17,2/21/2012,#ffd396,Carry On,4,0.3,3,9,
Some Nights,fun,17,2/21/2012,#ffd396,It Gets Better,5,0.4,0,0,"<p>I hate this song. I hate it so much that I deleted it from my Spotify library and when I was writing this I forgot that it was even on the album. I don't have much to say besides that I cannot listen to this song. For the purposes of this review I gave it a valiant effort but I couldn't make it through more than two minutes. It's like nails on a chalkboard. Lyrically, sonically, everything. I'm sorry, fun., I still like you but... no.</p>"
Some Nights,fun,17,2/21/2012,#ffd396,Why Am I the One,6,0.5,3,9,
Some Nights,fun,17,2/21/2012,#ffd396,All Alone,7,0.6,2,8,
Some Nights,fun,17,2/21/2012,#ffd396,All Alright,8,0.7,2,9,
Some Nights,fun,17,2/21/2012,#ffd396,One Foot,9,0.8,4,9,"<p>As with many fun. songs, the best part of ""One Foot"" is the bridge. All the bright horns and buoyant production go away and Ruess is left alone, singing</p> <p class=""lyrics"">Maybe I should learn to shut my mouth<br>I am over 25<br>And I can't make a name for myself<br>Some nights I break down and cry<br>I'm lucky that my father's still alive<br>He's been fighting all his life and if this is all I've ever known<br>Then may his soul live on, forever in my song<br>  </p> <p>I misheard that last line as ""forever in my sorrow"" for a good four years. I sort of still like it better than the real lyric. Ruess talks about his parents a lot in his lyrics. I like that, because I identify with his struggle to balance pursuing his dreams and staying close to family and not losing track of his roots.</p>
"
Some Nights,fun,17,2/21/2012,#ffd396,Stars,10,0.9,4,10,"<p>I think ""Stars"" is my favorite track on Some Nights. It's kind of sprawling and long and emotional, which tends to be my type of song, if history tells us anything. I remember when fun was getting big a lot of people criticized their use of autotune, but I never really saw why autotune is automatically a bad thing -- isn't it just another tool used by artists to get the sound in their head out into the world? It's not like Nate Ruess can't sing; he's got a great voice. The autotune in this song is used for effect. They're trying to show how Ruess feels more and more disconnected from his previous life as his fame grows.</p>"
Some Nights,fun,17,2/21/2012,#ffd396,Out On The Town,11,1,4,10,"<p>In a better world, ""Out On The Town"" would have taken ""It Gets Better""'s place on the original album. I don't know why they cut this song. I really love it, and I think that it fits well with the rest of the album, sonically speaking. Thematically, maybe it's a bit off base -- but so was ""It Gets Better"". Who knows.</p>"
Aim and Ignite,fun,16,8/25/2009,#e2db04,Be Calm,1,0,4,10,"<p><i>Be Calm</i> opens the album with a bang, signaling the manic nature of the album to come.</p>"
