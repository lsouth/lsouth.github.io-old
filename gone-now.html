      <img class="album-art" src="img/gonenow.jpg" width="100%" alt="gone now cover art"></img>
      <p>In the past, frontman Jack Antonoff has described the sound of Bleachers as someone struggling with their thoughts alone in a room -- and that description is still just as accurate today as it was in 2014, when Bleachers' first album, Strange Desire, was released.</p>
      <p>Although Strange Desire had its moments of external connection, like Rollercoaster and I Wanna Get Better (two of its most successful radio singles, by no coincidence), it was first and foremost a diaristic collection of internal thoughts and self-reflection. Gone Now is also innately diaristic and reflective, but now Jack is examining the people and events around him with the same intense focus that was directed at himself and his past in his earlier work.</p>
      <p>Much of this difference is likely due to the different circumstances in which the two albums were created. Jack has talked at length in previous interviews about writing, recording, and producing Strange Desire while on a long world tour with fun., his previous band. Many of the songs in Strange Desire were written in anonymous hotel rooms in foreign countries, so it's natural that they all seem to have a touch of isolation and loneliness in their DNA. Gone Now was created in Jack's home studio in Brooklyn, where he lived with his now ex-girlfriend, Lena Dunham. While working on Gone Now, Jack was busy co-writing and co-producing with many fellow artists, including Lorde, Taylor Swift, P!nk, and St Vincent. Working in such a comfortable, creatively-charged environment clearly enabled Jack to move out of his comfort zone and look to his surroundings for creative inspiration.</p>

      <p>
      <h4>Track listing </h4>
        <b>1. Dream of Mickey Mantle</b>
          <br>
          <p>Jack brings us into the world of Gone Now through a dream-like song that references a well-known (not to me, but to other people I presume) baseball player named Mickey Mantle. This song has the first mention of "rolling thunder", which will become a recurring phrase throughout the rest of the album.</p>
        <b>2. Goodmorning</b>
          <br>
          <p>In Goodmorning, Jack is simultaneously greeting the people and surroundings in his life while also contemplating an unnamed lie that he's told to someone close to him. Pro tip: listen with headphones to get the full stereo sound effect. It's fucking cool.</p>
        <b>3. Hate That You Know Me</b>
          <br>
          <p>This song is a bop. I love the drums. Lyrically, the song is about wishing that the people around you didn't know you so well because being known by someone inhibits your ability to change sometimes. The song is very upbeat and catchy, but some of the lyrics are devastating:</p>
          <br>
          <p class="lyrics">
            Some days I wish I wasn't myself<br>
            And I hate that you know me so well
          </p>
          <p>That's some Dancing in the Dark stuff right there. One thing that I like about this album, and Bleachers in general, is that Jack Antonoff isn't afraid to talk about the not-so-great aspects of relationships. I respect that. I can't help but view this song, and a couple of others on the album, in a different light now that Jack Antonoff and Lena Dunham, the quintessential millenial celebrity couple are no longer together. I'm very curious about what it's like to be in such a public relationship, but it's probably best to leave that to another post, another day.</p>

        <b>4. Don't Take The Money</b>
          <p>This is the anthemic mission statement of the album -- don't take the money! Don't give up on your gut feeling! Keep going even when things are tough! Jack has stated that this song is about what it's like to be in a real modern relationship, to fight with someone until you hit rock bottom and decide that you still really want to be with that person despite it all. The explosive chorus is meant to capture the euphoria of that realization. This song is a brilliant way to get people interested in the larger album. Like Jack always says, a good album is like a house. It needs a big front door that invites people in to see what the rest of the house is like. Don't Take The Money is a perfect example of a lead single that is thematically similar to the album, but has enough universal sentiment to intrigue new listeners.
        </p>
        <b>5. Everybody Lost Somebody</b>
        <p>
          This track is interesting to me because it could very easily have been written from the self-reflective perspective that characterized much of Jack's earlier work. The song is about loss, grief, and looking back at your past -- all common themes in later Steel Train songs and earlier Bleachers work. But the focus shifts in the chorus; Jack looks up from his reverie and notices that everyone around him is dealing with the same pain and carrying the same weight.
        </p>
        <b>6. All My Heroes</b>
        <p>
          This is one of my favorite tracks on the album. The production is just so cool. I love how Jack's vocals are stacked so in one ear he's singing the low harmony and in the other he's singing a higher part. It's awesome. I think All My Heroes feels the most similar to Strange Desire out of all the songs on Gone Now. I don't know why, but it does.
        </p>
        <b>7. Let's Get Married</b>
        <p>
          This song is about wanting to pull your loved ones close when the world gets stressful and scary. It's perhaps less romantic than it might seem to be at first, but it's still a sweet sentiment. And it's also a bop. The recurring voice asking the listener to "sit down, breathe, and just listen" comes from Lena Dunham, who pops up several times throughout the album to offer spoken word contributions to Jack's work. I think it's a sweet way to acknowledge sharing your life with someone. Even though Jack and Dunham work in different mediums, each is present in the other's art in subtle ways.
        </p>
        <b>8. Goodbye</b>
        <p>In this track, Jack orchestrates an interesting duet of sorts between himself and Dunham. Jack starts by saying goodbye repeatedly to the same people he greeted in Goodmorning. This slowly morphs into Jack musing on the themes of the album in vaguely non-sensical phrases while Dunham speaks in fragments about "radical beautiful acts" and "all these fears and all this pain" and other observations about being alive. It's a bizarre, unique song that took a while to grow on me, but now it's one of my favorites off of the album. The level of detail in the production of this short, seemingly simple song is really impressive. The album booklet only lists four lines on the lyric page for Goodbye:</p>
          <p class="lyrics">
            Goodbye to the friends I had<br>
            Goodbye to my upstairs neighbor<br>
            Goodbye to the kids downstairs and<br>
            Anybody who lent me a favor
          </p>
        <p>
          It's interesting to me that Jack chose to include only these lyrics, belying the insane complexity of everything happening underneath and between the repeating chorus of goodbyes.
        </p>
        <b>9. I Miss Those Days</b>
        <p>
          This song calls back to the more light-hearted, upbeat nature of the first half of the album. Jack reminisces about the days when he was "lost", dealing with the death of his sister and touring the country with a commercially unsuccessful band.
        </p>
        <b>10. Nothing Is U</b>
        <p>
          Jack stated on Twitter a few months ago that Nothing Is U is the only straightforward love song on the album. It's true -- he is simply stating that nothing has changed him quite like the subject of this song (presumably Dunham). One interesting tidbit: Jack talks about "rolling thunder" a lot on this album, but this is the only mention of just thunder, with no additional descriptors. This is also the only time thunder is described in a seemingly positive light, as Jack sings:
        </p>
        <p class="lyrics">
          Will it feel like thunder, when the long drive's over? <br>
          I will walk in silence with you <br>
          Yes, I will wander in silence with you <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared to Jack's other references to rolling thunder, this one seems to have a much more positive connotation. He's walking in silence with his partner, which seems pleasant to me.
          <br>
          For example, in Dream of Mickey Mantle and later in I'm Ready To Move On/Mickey Mantle (Reprise), Jack repeats the line "Rolling thunder had cursed my bedroom" over and over. Similarly, in Goodmorning Jack equates rolling thunder with the weight of the lie he's told to someone close to him:
        </p>
        <p class="lyrics">
          What a weight to live under <br>
          What a lie that's been covered <br>
          I'm talking about (I'm a comedian) rolling thunder <br>
          I know I left you on the street last night <br>
          So I'm holding on, grabbing at a light <br>
        </p>
        <b>11. I'm Ready To Move On/Mickey Mantle (Reprise)</b>
        <p>
          For the penultimate track of Gone Now, Jack calls back to the structure of Strange Desire -- both albums have a song named I'm Ready To Move On, joined with a reprise of the first song on each album, as their second to last track. I hope Jack continues this tradition with his future work. It's a cool, subtle way to refer back to where he's come from. The two songs have similar names, but they couldn't be more sonically different. I'm Ready To Move On/Mickey Mantle (Reprise) starts with a bright, happy-sounding instrumental track that gradually slows and becomes morose as Jack sings on top of it about sitting alone waiting for a bus that never comes and wondering why he should wait to tell someone he loves them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The track suddenly shifts into high gear after Jack sings about the mysterious "rolling thunder" that he's mentioned in Dream of Mickey Mantle, Goodmorning, and (sort of) Nothing Is U, which in this song has "cursed [his] bedroom". The instrumental is no longer happy and bouncy -- it feels like it's building to something big. Jack is now sings what I think is the real theme statement of the album, which is "I want to get free, from your world, from your bad dream/I want to get lost, but there's still so much I'd like to say". He's nearing the end of the album and he's spent so long processing his past and scrutinizing himself -- and now he wants to get free. He wants to get lost and be a new person without all of this baggage, but he recognizes that there is more that he needs to say to the world and to those around him.
        </p>
        <p>
          That line is really the last new thought of the track. The remainder is another spoken word duet, but this time it is Jack's friend Camilla Venturini who repeats several statements about getting herself home soon and being grateful (this is most likely a reference to "I wanna be grateful for the experiences I've had", a phrase that popped up throughout Strange Desire) while Jack once again says his goodbyes to his surroundings and "everyone who'd lend [him] a favor".
        </p>
        <b>12. Foreign Girls</b>
        <p>Jack has stated that Foreign Girls is sort of an apology for the heaviness of everything that came before it. It begins with a trumpet playing a soft, delicate melodic line. Jack soon joins in, singing about being a stranger to his loved ones and trying to make up for it any way he can in a pitched-up voice that my friends and I affectionately refer to as "muppet voice". This is the only time he says the title of the album: "Gone now/Thinking what's gone now". Also, Foreign Girls was recently removed from the live show setlist and it makes me very sad. The song, and by extension the album, ends with the same chorus of goodbyes that we've now heard in three separate songs. But this time Jack adds one more line: "I loved you all". This last sentence is repeated over and over as the album fades out, and we're left wondering exactly what Jack means by this farewell. Is this the end of Bleachers? Is it the end of Jack looking to his past for creative inspiration? Is Jack telling us that he's finally ready to move on, like he's been saying for the past two albums?
        </p>
    </p>
    <h4>Final thoughts</h4>
    <p>This is a very good album. I would recommend it to anyone looking to get into Bleachers. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it on repeat as research for this post. I do have one lingering question that I would love to ask Jack Antonoff if I ever have the opportunity:</p>
    <p>
      What does the red dot on the album art mean? Jack's teased its meaning in several interviews, but he's always said he's going to reveal everything at a later date. Well, the Gone Now era is nearing its end and we still haven't gotten a firm answer. The time is now, Jack Antonoff.
