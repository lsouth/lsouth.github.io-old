      <p>I started listening to Bleachers while living in New Jersey for a few months last summer and working at a job that required me to sit and read academic papers for much of the day. I needed new music to listen to while reading, and I decided to give Bleachers a shot. I knew exactly three things about Bleachers: First, I knew that I really liked the song “I Wanna Get Better”, which was released during my last semester of high school. Second, I knew that Jack Antonoff was in fun., the band responsible for one of my favorite radio hits ever, Some Nights. Finally, I knew that Jack Antonoff had had a significant role in creating all of the promotional singles that I’d enjoyed off of Melodrama. I trust Lorde's opinion more than most people, so I figured if she likes Jack Antonoff he had to be at least somewhat good. </p>
      <p>The first song that grabbed me and made me think that Bleachers might be for me was a song called "Like a River Runs". One line in particular hit me like a brick wall:<p>
      <p class="lyrics">
      When I fall asleep, I can see your face<br>
      What I lost in you, I will not replace.</p>
      <p>
      I didn't even know what the song was written about yet, but I didn't need to. I was recovering from a loss and that lyric somehow encapsulated my entire mental state at that moment. How do you move on from a loss, while still remembering the effect that person had on your life and appreciating the things that person brought to you? I later learned that Jack wrote the song about losing his sister to brain cancer when she was 13. It was actually the first song he wrote for Strange Desire. Even though I know and love lots of Jack Antonoff songs now, I will always have a special place in my heart for this one because I found it at the exact moment I most needed to hear it and it brought me into the world of Bleachers.</p>

      <p>I had never had a favorite band before I listened to Bleachers. I'd had songs I really liked, or maybe albums that I could listen to over and over, but I'd never felt much of an emotional connection to one specific band. It's wonderful to love an artist so strongly that you're willing to travel and spend money and wait outside venues to experience their art. It’s a joy to enjoy an artist so much that you want to expose everyone you know to their work. I'd never felt that before this band, and I'm so grateful to Jack Antonoff for creating work that speaks to me so powerfully.</p>
