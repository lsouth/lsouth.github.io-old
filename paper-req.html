<p>Advisor statement (Prof. Michelle Borkin): </p>
<p>Laura South has fulfilled her paper requirement through the submission and acceptance of the paper "Detecting and Defending Against Seizure-Inducing GIFs in Social Media" to be published in the proceedings of ACM CHI (Computer-Human Interaction) 2021 (AR ~24%). The paper was accepted for publication in January 2021 and will be published as part of the proceedings in April 2021. Laura is the first author of the paper, and was the project lead for the entirety of the research from project proposal to task analysis, data gathering, generation, system development, deployment, and evaluation to the final paper composition. The project is directly based on Laura's successfully funded NSF Graduate Research Fellowship proposal (awarded in 2019). The project, motivated specifically by the need to develop better tools to protect individuals browsing the web with photosensitive conditions including photosensitive epilepsy (PSE), resulted in the creation of a new browser plugin to protect PSE individuals. The process of designing and validating this new plugin involved the creation of a novel database of PSE-inducing material gathered from the web as well as generated and the creation of novel detection algorithms. All of this work was planned, organized, and conceived by Laura and primarily executed by Laura.  Throughout this project she demonstrated independent research motivation, critical thinking, strategy, and problem solving. This work solidly demonstrates Laura's ability to be an independent successful researcher and complete her dissertation.</p>
