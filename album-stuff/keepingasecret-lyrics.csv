1,1:38,1:40,jack,misc,And what a choice to choose
1,1:41,1:43,jack,misc,To be held by somebody who slips in and out of themselves
1,1:44,1:45,jack,kas,I wait -- hard keeping a secret
1,1:47,1:51,jack,misc,All my guts push me out
1,1:52,1:54,jack,misc,I sit on your front stoop
1,1:56,2:01,jack,misc,"And oh my god, I've changed myself"
1,2:02,2:03,jack,misc,To what we might do
1,2:05,2:07,backup,kas,If we stop keeping a secret

1,2:46,2:47,jack,misc,Fade into my mind
1,2:49,2:50,jack,misc,Cause I think about you
1,2:52,2:55,jack,misc,Like this piece of me that's right there but I can't grab you
1,2:56,2:58,jack,misc,So fade into my mind
1,2:59,3:03,jack,misc,And I torture myself wondering if you're doing exactly what I'm doing
1,3:05,3:07,jack,misc,"Imagining, imagining"
1,3:10,3:12,jack,misc,And it all fades away
