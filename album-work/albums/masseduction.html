      <p>Annie Clark, the mastermind behind St Vincent, has never struggled with originality, creativity, or playing the guitar insanely well, and her latest release makes that more clear than ever. MASSEDUCTION is my favorite St Vincent record because it is her most brutally honest, unapologetic work thus far. It's a beautiful and sad meditation on power, loss, and lust.</p>

      <p>Clark strikes me as someone who chooses to hide her vulnerability behind meticulously crafted production and complex lyrics, rather than displaying it openly. I have no problem with that approach -- I think that's how I would probably write music if I had chosen a different path in life -- but it's refreshing to see Clark work from a more emotionally direct perspective on MASSEDUCTION.
      </p>
      <p>
      I confess that I feel slightly unprepared to write about MASSEDUCTION and Annie Clark as an artist because I am a very new fan, but I'm going to carry on with the confidence of a mediocre man and pretend that I am very knowledgeable. Annie, I am very sorry if I get any facts wrong. I still love you. Let's do this.

      <h4>Track Listing:</h4>
      <p>
        <b>1. Hang On Me</b>
        <p>In this album opener, Clark croons to an anonymous lover that they are "not for this world" over a programmed beat and a synth. It's like the sad, dystopian version of Robyn's Hang With Me. Or maybe I'm just seeing that connection because I like both songs. Who knows. Anyways, this is a fine song, but it's far from my favorite on the album as a whole. Don't worry, it gets much better.</p>
        <b>2. Pills</b>
        <p>
          This song is just so fucking cool. It took a couple of tries before I really got into this song, but I think a large part of that can be attributed to my unfamiliarity with Clark's style. The nursery rhyme-like chorus is sung by Cara Delevingne, the famous model and coincidentally Clark's ex-girlfriend. My favorite part of the song is the outro, when the snappy beat and pumped-up chorus drops off and there's like a solid two minutes of slow chord progressions while Clark beckons "all you wasted, wretched, and scorned" and reminds us that "everyone you love will all go away". That's not something I'm used to hearing in songs, particularly not in singles, but I think it's an awesome, bold choice.This song is just so fucking cool.

        <b>3. Masseduction</b>
        <p></p>
        <b>4. Sugarboy</b>
        <p></p>
        <b>5. Los Ageless</b>
        <p>I think it's a travesty that this song didn't get more radio play. It's so good! I've noticed that sometimes when songs get released as singles, they lose a bit of the album feeling and sort of feel detached from the rest of the work. I haven't noticed that with Los Ageless. It still feels very connected to the overall structure of Masseduction to me. But my favorite part of the song is the last minute or so, which is just Clark talking very softly about losing a relationship underneath the last few chords of the song. I probably listened to this song five or six times before I even noticed that the last minute wasn't just an instrumental bit. I imagine that was probably Clark's intention.</p>
        <b>6. Happy Birthday, Johnny</b>
        <p></p>
        <b>7. Savior</b>
        <p></p>
        <b>8. New York</b>
        <p></p>
        <b>9. Fear The Future</b>
        <p>Fear The Future is the lowest point on the album to me. I can enjoy listening to it if I'm in the right mood, but usually it is too jarring to really enjoy.</p>
        <b>10. Young Lover</b>
        <p></p>
        <b>11. Dancing With A Ghost</b>
        <p></p>
        <b>12. Slow Disco</b>
        <p></p>
        <b>13. Smoking Section</b>
