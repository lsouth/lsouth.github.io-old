		<h1>Hewlett Packard Enterprise TCO Calculator</h1>
		<h2>Project Description</h2>
		<h4>As an intern at Hewlett Packard Enterprise from May 2016 to May 2017, I was in charge of developing what became known as the Simplified Rally TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) Calculator for the worldwide Business Development team. What began as a simple command-line tool used only by our team quickly grew into a GUI-based sales tool used by representatives around the world to support various sales initiatives. Basically, I created a program to estimate cost savings for HPE customers considering a technology refresh for their outdated datacenter environments. In addition to coding the logic behind these simulations, I created a user interface and a report-generating utility so the calculator's output could be easily understood by all interested parties.</h4>
		<h2>Design Challenges</h2>
		<h4>My calculator was created to fill a need that was not met by any of HPE's existing range of deeply technical and extremely complex TCO calculators. The primary goal of my calculator was to provide a simple, clear expression of complicated datacenter cost savings principles that could be easily understood by a non-technical audience. It was clear from talking to sales representatives that a fast, simple calculator that could be used on-the-fly in a sales meeting was desperately needed. After working on this project for a few weeks, it was also clear why something like my calculator didn't exist</h4>
